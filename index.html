                    </div>
                    <p>More people are getting into debt as a result of the "buy now, think later" mentality promoted by social media. Due to ongoing pressure to purchase trendy goods, many people wind up using their credit cards to the limit and depleting their funds. Innocent scrolling can rapidly turn into impulsive purchases and financial difficulties.</p>

                    <p>Our landfills reveal the truth about social media shopping. Piles of barely-used items, fast fashion, and trendy products end up as trash when they go out of style. Every shopping haul adds to an environmental crisis that keeps growing.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Consumer culture can be detrimental in schools. Children who don't own the newest brands or fashions are made fun of. Exclusion may result from wearing out-of-date clothing, having the "wrong" bag, or even having a phony Stanley water bottle. People who can buy trendy items and those who cannot are separated as a result.</p>

                    <p>Mental health is harmed by continuous exposure to idealized lifestyles and never-ending shopping content. A vicious circle of self-comparison, want for more, purchase, and disappointment traps people. The thrill of making a new purchase quickly wanes and is replaced by pressure to stay up to date with the latest trends and credit card worry.</p>

                    <h2>Break The Cycle</h2>
                    <p>The never-ending cycle of shopping needs to end. True pleasure does not come from copying influencers or owning the newest fashions. If we are conscious of our social media and shopping habits, we might have a better relationship with our screens and our finances.</p>
